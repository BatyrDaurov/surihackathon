        Clickbait is designed to grab your attention and lure you into clicking,
        often using exaggerated or misleading headlines. Here’s a practical
        guide on how to handle it:
        <ol>
          <li>If you notice a provocative or improbable headline—pause.</li>
          <li>Do not click the link or share the material.</li>
          <li>
            Copy keywords from the headline and search for this news on
            authoritative websites.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the material is misleading or potentially dangerous, use the
            &quot;Report&quot; function on the platform.
          </li>
        </ol>

            Spelling Errors in Key Elements Example: Grammatical mistakes, typos

          <li>
            Before taking action, ensure you are dealing with a coordinated
            campaign and not genuine user opinions. Look for key indicators:
            mass volume and uniformity of messages, suspiciously empty or
            recently created accounts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not rise to the bait. Do not engage in arguments or try to
            convince them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the &quot;Report&quot; button on every suspicious comment and
            account. As the reason, specify &quot;Spam,&quot; &quot;Coordinated
            misinformation,&quot; &quot;Fake account,&quot; or &quot;Suspicious
            activity.&quot;
          </li>
          <li>
            Calmly and rationally inform other users about it. Leave your own
            comment to draw attention to the manipulation.
